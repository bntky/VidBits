Nice Job! you created a full-stack web application that allows a user
to create, retrieve, update, and delete records from a database.

You developed this web application using the red, green, refactor
cycle to ensure that your application works as expected. We encourage
you to continue working on this application using your outside-in TDD
skills. Although some of the following extension activities may seem
challenging, start in the red, and slowly build your desired
functionality.

- Add a notion of anonymous comments to the application.
- Create different roles for the different users of the web page. You
  probably only want administrators to be able to create, update, and
  delete records.
- Make it so you can post videos or gifs to the application.

Good luck as you continue your TDD journey. Remember, you donâ€™t have
to solve the entire implementation problem right away. Start by
writing a test at the feature level, then work your way down.
